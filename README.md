File Parser CRUD API with Real-Time Progress TrackingThis is a backend application built with Spring Boot and MySQL that provides a RESTful API for uploading, parsing, and managing files. It features asynchronous processing for large files and real-time progress tracking using WebSockets. The API is secured using JWT authentication.FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).File Upload: Supports large file uploads via a multipart/form-data endpoint.Asynchronous Parsing: File parsing is handled in the background, preventing API blocking. Currently supports text extraction from PDF files.Real-Time Progress Tracking: Uses WebSockets (with SockJS & STOMP) to push live progress updates to the client.Full CRUD Functionality:Create: Upload files.Read: List all files and retrieve parsed content of a specific file.Delete: Remove a file and its associated data.Database Persistence: All file metadata and parsed content are stored in a MySQL database.Tech StackBackend: Spring Boot 3Database: MySQLSecurity: Spring Security, JWTReal-time Communication: Spring WebSocket, STOMP, SockJSFile Parsing: Apache PDFBoxBuild Tool: MavenðŸš€ Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get the application running locally.PrerequisitesJava (JDK 17 or later)Apache MavenMySQL ServerAn API testing tool like Postman1.

cd file-parser
2. Configure the DatabaseOpen your MySQL client.Create a new database for the application. The application will create the necessary tables on startup.CREATE DATABASE file_parser_db;
3. Configure Application PropertiesNavigate to src/main/resources/application.properties.Update the MySQL connection details (spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, spring.datasource.password) to match your local setup.spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/file_parser_db
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
Important: Change the jwt.secret to a long, random, and secure string. This is crucial for security.jwt.secret=your-very-long-and-secure-secret-key-that-is-at-least-256-bits
4. Build and Run the ApplicationYou can run the application using the Maven wrapper:# On Windows
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# On macOS/Linux
./mvnw spring-boot:run
The application will start on http://localhost:8080.API DocumentationThe API is secured with JWT. You must first register and authenticate to get a token, which must be included in the Authorization header for all protected endpoints.Authorization Header Format: Bearer <your_jwt_token>Authentication1. Register a New UserEndpoint: POST /registerDescription: Creates a new user account.Request Body:{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123"
}
Success Response (200 OK):{
    "id": 1,
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "$2a$10$..." // Hashed password
}
2. Authenticate and Get JWTEndpoint: POST /authenticateDescription: Logs in a user and returns a JWT.Request Body:{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123"
}
Success Response (200 OK):eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0dXNlciIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDIzMzgwMCwiZXhwIjoxNzI0MjY5ODAwfQ.exampleTokenString
File Management (Authentication Required)1. Upload a FileEndpoint: POST /filesDescription: Uploads a file for processing.Request Body: multipart/form-data with a key file.Success Response (200 OK):{
    "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "fileName": "mydocument.pdf",
    "fileType": "application/pdf",
    "size": 102400,
    "status": "UPLOADING",
    "parsedContent": null,
    "createdAt": "2025-08-21T14:00:00.000000"
}
2. Get File ProgressEndpoint: GET /files/{file_id}/progressDescription: Retrieves the current processing status and progress of a file.Success Response (200 OK):{
    "fileId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "status": "PROCESSING",
    "progress": 50
}
3. Get Parsed File ContentEndpoint: GET /files/{file_id}Description: Fetches the parsed text content of a file once it's ready.Success Response (200 OK):"This is the full text content extracted from the PDF document..."
Error Response (If processing failed):{
    "message": "File processing failed."
}
4. List All FilesEndpoint: GET /filesDescription: Returns a list of all uploaded files with their metadata.Success Response (200 OK):[
    {
        "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
        "fileName": "mydocument.pdf",
        "fileType": "application/pdf",
        "size": 102400,
        "status": "READY",
        "parsedContent": "This is the full text...",
        "createdAt": "2025-08-21T14:00:00.000000"
    }
]
5. Delete a FileEndpoint: DELETE /files/{file_id}Description: Deletes a file and its associated data from the server.Success Response (200 OK):"File deleted successfully"
Real-Time Progress Tracking (WebSockets)To receive live progress updates, a client must:Connect: Establish a WebSocket connection to the /ws endpoint.Subscribe: After uploading a file and getting its id, the client must send a SUBSCRIBE frame to the destination /topic/progress/{file_id}.The server will then automatically push messages to this topic as the file's status changes.Sample Progress Message:{
    "fileId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "status": "READY",
    "progress": 100
}
Testing with PostmanA Postman collection is provided to make testing easy.Import the Collection: Import the File Parser API.postman_collection.json file into Postman.Set Up Environment: The collection is configured to use a jwt_token variable. After you run the POST /authenticate request, the collection's test script will automatically save the token to this variable.Run Requests: All protected endpoints under the "File Management" folder are pre-configured to use this token for authentication. Simply run the requests in order.
